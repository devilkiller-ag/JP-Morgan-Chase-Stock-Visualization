# JPMorgan Chase Stock Data Visualization (1980 - 2025)

## Overview
This Preswald application provides an interactive visualization of JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s stock data from 1980 to 2025. It includes market capitalization, revenue, and earnings trends, leveraging `pandas` for data manipulation and `plotly.express` for visualizations.

## Dataset
- **Source**: The dataset used in this project is `JPM_1940-01-01_2025-03-04.csv` present in the `data` folder, which contains historical stock data for JPMorgan Chase. It was originally shared on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/umerhaddii/jpmorgan-chase-stock-data-2025/data) by Umer Haddii.
- **Columns**: The dataset includes columns such as `date`, `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, `volume`, and other stock market indicators.
- **Preprocessing**: The `date` column is converted to `datetime` for proper formatting and visualization.

## Features of the Application
1. **Market Capitalization Analysis**  
   - Market cap is calculated as `closing price × outstanding shares (2.8 billion)`.  
   - An interactive area chart visualizes the trend of market capitalization over time.  
   - A dynamic annotation is added to highlight the latest market cap value.

2. **Revenue Analysis**
